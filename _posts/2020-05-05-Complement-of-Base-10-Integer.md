###此题与476 Number Complement 完全相同

### 题目

Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11 as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.  For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.

For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

### 解题思路

对应一个n位数m，最后的结果为`(2**n - 1) ^ m` （2的n次幂减一的结果异或m）

### 代码
```python
class Solution:
    def bitwiseComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
        if N == 0:
            return 1
        x = 1
        while x <= N:
            x <<= 1
        return (x - 1) ^ N```
