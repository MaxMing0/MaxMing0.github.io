### 题目

We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
- If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

### 解题思路

使用优先队列，将石子从放到优先队列（大头）中，每次pop出来最大的两个，做差（如果非0）将绝对值加回队里中，直到结束

### 代码
```python
import heapq
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-s for s in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)
        while len(stones) >= 2:
            s1 = heapq.heappop(stones)
            s2 = heapq.heappop(stones)
            if s1 != s2:
                heapq.heappush(stones, s1 - s2)
        return -stones[0] if stones else 0
```
