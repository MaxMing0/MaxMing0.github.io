### 题目

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

### 解题思路



### 代码
```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        s = {n}
        while n != 1:
            tmp = sum([int(c) ** 2 for c in str(n)])
            if tmp in s:
                return False
            s.add(tmp)
            n = tmp
        return True
```
